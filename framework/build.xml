    <!-- The build.properties file can be created by you and is never touched
         by the 'android' tool. This is the place to change some of the default property values
         used by the Ant rules.
         Here are some properties you may want to change/update:

         application-package
             the name of your application package as defined in the manifest. Used by the
             'uninstall' rule.
         source-folder
             the name of the source folder. Default is 'src'.
         out-folder
             the name of the output folder. Default is 'bin'.

         Properties related to the SDK location or the project target should be updated
          using the 'android' tool with the 'update' action.

         This file is an integral part of the build system for your application and
         should be checked in in Version Control Systems.

    <!-- Execute the Android Setup task that will setup some properties specific to the target,
         and import the rules files.
         To customize the rules, copy/paste them below the task, and disable import by setting
         the import attribute to false:
            <setup import="false" />
         
         This will ensure that the properties are setup correctly but that your customized
         targets are used.
